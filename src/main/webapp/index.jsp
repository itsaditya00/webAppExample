      <p>The Web is an odd industry to work for when you take the time to think about it. I can’t think of many professions where a person’s job becomes such a large part of their lifestyle.

        The 9-to-5 job is commonplace for the majority of the working population, with few taking their work home with them. Can you imagine a tax accountant doing her work at home simply for fun?
        
        Yet, for us — web designers, web developers, UI/UX designers and the like — it’s not uncommon to get home and immediately jump into the computer or undertake something else Web-related, even when we’re off the clock.</p>
